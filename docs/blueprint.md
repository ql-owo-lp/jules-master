- Job Title Generation: Employ a tool, based on the provided prompts for job creation, to create titles that summarize what each job should do.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to convey reliability and integration with Google's services. The blue hue mirrors those found in Google's interfaces but at a lower saturation, making it developer friendly.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that focuses attention on the API functionality.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A) for interactive elements and key actions to add a modern and engaging touch.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, should be used because its machined, objective, neutral look conveys a sense of being contemporary and precise.
- Use simple, line-based icons to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic. Icons should be related to job management and API settings.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout, with the input box prominently displayed and the job list easily accessible. The settings menu should be easily accessible via the top-right menu icon.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience. For example, a smooth slide-in animation when opening the settings menu.
